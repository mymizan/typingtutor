VanillaJS Typing Tutor (numpad only)
========================================

This is a demo of a typing tutor that I wrote in just over two hours while getting familiar with javascript. The code isn't too pretty, but get the job done. The numpad concept can be extended to include the full keyborad. The concept can be taken further to implement a full featured typing tutor based on pure javascripts. I didn't use any 3rd party library. It's all pure js, some html and css. I will leave this project right here and hope to add the full keyboard support someday ;-)

You are welcome to take the concept or do whatever you wish to do with it. I though think anyone slightly familiar with javascript will know how to make one in an hour. But, since you are reading....
